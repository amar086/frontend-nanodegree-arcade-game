## Game Description

To run the game, the index.html file needs to be open.

In the game we have a player and some enemies (bugs) to overcome. The goal of the player is to reach the water(top tiles) without colliding into any of the enemies.

The player can move left, right, up and down and the enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.
When the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to his starting point.

Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won and a modal appears allowing the player to click on a "Start Over" button.
